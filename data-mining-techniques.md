# Sample datasets and codes for the data mining techniques lab

## Sample dataset
1. Simple linear regression
* [Oxygen purity dataset](/data-samples/oxygen-purity.csv)
* The dataset shows a positive relationship between the percentage of hydrocarbons and the purity of oxygen.

2. Multpile linear regression
* [Gas production dataset](/data-samples/gas-production.csv)
* The dataset contains relationships among various gas production features.

3. k-NN classficiation
* [Iris dataset](/data-samples/iris.csv)
* We will use the length and width of sepal and species data for the lab.

4. Decision tree
* Use the same iris.csv dataset but we will use the length and width of sepal and petal for this techqniue.

5. k-means clustering
* [Sample clustering dataset](/data-samples/clustering-sample.csv)
* The dataset contains random data, which can be categorized into three clusters.

6. Moving average
* [Apple stock price dataset](/data-samples/aapl.csv)

7. Exponential smoothing - forecasting
* [Air passengers dataset](/data-samples/air-passengers.csv)
* The dataset contains information of monthly passengers totals of a US airline from 1949 to 1960.

8. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* [Amazon top selling book dataset](/data-samples/amazon-top-selling-book.csv)
* The dataset contatins top selling books information from 2009 to 2019.

9. Correlation analsysi and heat map
* Use the same dataset for PCA.
